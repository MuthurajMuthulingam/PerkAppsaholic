Introduction :

 Every Tech buisines heavily rely on user base for sucees in their Business model. Considering this, We are also try to develope a product (in fact, ProtoType) to demontrate our Idea of approching this aspect in a Travel domain.
 
 Functionality of Product :
  
      We are majorly focus on Two side of B2C model.
       1. Enaging and retain User Base 
       2. Having growth along with Business partners as well as with User. In other words, Maximixing profit to busines and            their consumers.

      2. Restful API integration to maintain Travelling entities list on remote server.(As of now, We uses Localhost).
      3.Social share : to attract more consumer towards various services offered by Travel Agent and Appsaholic SDK.
      If Time Permits: we plan to offer Referal program to consumers with a set of operations from Back end.
      
  Approching Challenges :
  
       We catagorize consumers in two aspects,
         1. Who cares about Price of journey
         2. Who cares about Quality of Service rather than Price.
         
         Idea is to, cover all these catgories, Planing to offer more Perk points to Travels which provide more expensive      journey than others.
         Secondly, offering more Perk points to Travels which provides less Quality of service to get them more user base.
         Hence user wil be retained and To get their engagement towards their usage within application, we used to offer
         Sharing feature (and referal Program, if time Permits).
